# Eggstractor Mod

A minecraft mod that adds an enchantment for weapons called "Eggstracting" that allows you to obtain Spawn Eggs in Survival Mode.

It supports [Optifines](https://optifine.net/home) CIT (or any similar mod, that adds CIT support in Optifine format) and [Enchantment Descriptions](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchantment-descriptions).

I created this mod as an alternative to [Apotheosis'](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis/) Capturing Enchantment.

## Levels

The enchantment has three levels:

+ **Level 1**: 0,5% Chance of dropping
+ **Level 2**: 1% Chance of dropping
+ **Level 3**: 1,5% Chance of dropping

Before 1.20:
+ **Level 1**: 0,25% Chance of dropping
+ **Level 2**: 0,5% Chance of dropping
+ **Level 3**: 0,75% Chance of dropping
